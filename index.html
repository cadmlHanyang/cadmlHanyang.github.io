<h1>Computation and Data Management Laboratory</h1>

<h2>History of the research group</h2>
<table id="tText">
  <tr>
    <td>
      The CaDML is a part of the Hanyang Universitie's Department of Computer Science within the College of Engineering. The main goal behind creation of CaDML is to improve performance of other departments of College of Engineering in the respective fields. In order to accomplish that, the students working within the lab have domain knowledge from their original fields, which is amplified with CS.
      <p>It has been widely observed that the XXI century has faced the academic world with a new challenge of ever growing data and ever more complex tasks. The <a href="https://jakevdp.github.io/blog/2014/08/22/hacking-academia/">Hacking Academia: Data Science and the University</a> puts this idea in greater detail. Our goal is to make it true.</p>

    <td>
      CaDML is working with different departments providing effective and cheap software/hardware solutions which increase efficiency. Our publications may be found using <a href="scholar.google.com/">Google Scholar.</a> On of the avenues of our research is web bloat, which makes websites inaccessible when low bandwidth connections are the only option. Dan Luu has made a great piece about it <a href="https://danluu.com/web-bloat/">How web bloat affects people with slow connections</a> also <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tefielQeHZY">Bryan Lunduke's clip</a> touches highly on this topic.
